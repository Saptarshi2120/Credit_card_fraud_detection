# Credit_card_fraud_detection_system
Successful development and implementation of a credit card fraud detection system using decision tree classifier algorithm üîç 
and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearch CV algorithm. 

Decision trees are a powerful machine learning technique that allows us to classify data based on various features and decision rules. 
By training the model on historical data containing both legitimate and fraudulent transactions,
we were able to build an intelligent system that could predict and flag suspicious transactions accurately. Employed GridSearchCV to 
systematically search and tune hyperparameters, resulting in the selection of the optimal hyperparameter configuration for the 
decision tree model.
